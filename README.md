Funnycoin. Prototype java cryptocurency. Pretty cool!

I started this in february 2021 and worked on it on and off and decided to revive it this summer. It would work if people ran nodes but I don't want to leave my computer on 24/7 for something completely useless. 
It shows a large array of things that I've done like socketing, P2P networking, Server-sided and client sided applications etc. Runs with JSON data and events.
